										<h1>Module 8 Reflections</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In this module, I embarked on a research process on the topic of cyber security controls in Intelligent Transportation Systems that led to the creation of key artefacts required in independent academic research. Both the summative assignments and formative activities allowed me to build on previous modules and hone my research skills in a manner that will benefit both my future academic research and my professional work.</p>
									<h2>Research Skills</h2>
									<p>This module presented a steep learning curve for me as, having not completed a degree prior to my Masters course, I have limited experience with in-depth academic research. However, I was able to leverage my professional experience and previous studies in both cyber security and data protection to support my submissions, including the <a href="M8Links/U7 Literature Review - Final.docx">Literature Review</a>, <a href="M8Links/U10 Research Proposal.pptx">Research Proposal</a> and <a href="M8Links/U5 Reflective Activity 2.docx">Reflective Activity 2</a>. In addition, the focus academic institutions put on ethics in research comes across as a form of risk management for individuals and the institutions themselves (Svedin, 2015). In this way, cyber security skills can be transferable to other research topics, such as <a href="M8Links/U1 Reflective Activity - Ethics in Computing v3.docx">Ethics in Computing</a>.</p>
									<p>I chose to research security in transportation systems as ongoing innovation creates many opportunities for novel research and there is a lot of interest in the security of these systems as they are considered to be critical infrastructure  (Holland-Letz et al., 2021; Cabinet Office, 2017). In order to provide a strong foundation for my research process, I followed a strategic approach to my <a href="M8Links/U7 Literature Review - Final.docx">Literature Review</a>. This included following best practice steps defined in my <a href="M8Links/U2 Literature review guide questions.docx">initial plan</a>, using my intelligence training to refine literature search results and categorizing sources in an <a href="M8Links/U7 Literature Review Source Categorisation.xlsx">Excel Spreadsheet</a> in order to narrow down the subject area (Dawson, 2015). In addition, I found that researching a subject I am interested in helped me to maintain momentum and even led to insightful conversations with colleagues who have research experience in autonomous vehicle vulnerabilities. The development demonstrated between <a href="M8_artefacts.html">artefacts</a>, from the <a href="M8Links/U4 RMPP Literature Review Outline.docx">Literature Review Outline</a> and <a href="M8Links/U8 Research Proposal Outline.pptx">Research Proposal Outline</a> to the final products, as well as the accompanying <a href="M8_feedback.html">feedback</a> are testament to my strategic research process.</p>

									<h2>Final Project</h2>
									<p>As I opted for a cyber security topic, the research process undertaken in this module felt like a dry run for the initial stages of the final Masters project. Whilst I intend to cover a different topic for my final MSc project, this module helped me to develop both the confidence and skills to embark on my independent research. As I learned more throughout the module, I was able to adapt my final project idea from my <a href="M8Links/U6 MSc Project - Initial Ideas.docx">initial ideas</a> into a preliminary <a href="M8Links/U10 MSc Project Outline.docx">outline</a>. For example, from completing the <a href="M8Links/U10 Research Proposal.pptx">Research Proposal</a>, I learnt that my original idea was too narrow so I have opted for a richer topic where the end product could take several forms depending on my research direction. The formative assignments regarding the final project have led me to find a supervisor and establish a good dialogue well ahead of starting my final project module in May. Furthermore, during this module, I have gained experience with technologies that will be invaluable during my final project, including Mendeley for managing references and journal email alerts for identifying new research (Mendeley, 2021; IEEE, 2022). Given the duration of the final project, these technologies will allow me to maintain academic integrity and also stay abreast of current research on my topic.</p>

									<h2>Work</h2>
									<p>During this module, I have noticed a difference in the way research is approached between business and academia. Previous corporate security research I have been involved in, including gathering customer feedback on new security features and contributing to threat intelligence reports, involved no referencing and minimal scrutiny of methodology and sources. These observations are likely attributable to the difference in purpose of academic and corporate research (Price, 2015). However, this has inspired me to incorporate academic techniques into my future research at work, for example referencing sources could enable my colleagues to read further on topics of interest and boost the integrity of my work (Dawson, 2015).</p>
									<p>I have found my previous professional experiences and my learnings in the module to be mutually beneficial in a number of ways. On the one hand, my previous experience in managing professional projects allowed me to successfully plan and complete all of the assignments in the module within the given deadlines through effectively treating the units as Scrum sprints (Gon√ßalves, 2018). On the other hand, the knowledge I gained from the <a href="M8Links/U8 Statistics Worksheets.zip">statistical analysis</a> and <a href="M8Links/U9 Charts Worksheets.zip">vizualisation</a> exercises will allow me to make more educated decisions regarding the way I use and present data when creating various reports for my management team. Furthermore, I have learnt new ways of using Excel to automate the creation of a wide range of statistics and charts for use in business reports. As recommended by the tutor, I have now included learning the basics of R in my <a href="M8Links/U11 Action Plan Template.docx">action plan</a> to build my data science skills further (Wickham & Grolemund, 2016).</p>

									<h2>Double Module</h2>
									<p>Due to the academic confidence I have gained over the past year in my Masters studies, I chose to double up on modules and was studying Digital Forensics and Cyber Law (DFCL) alongside this module. Whilst this created a high workload, I found some of the content to be complementary. For example, I used my knowledge of cyber law from DFCL to support my posts in <a href="https://www.my-course.co.uk/mod/hsuforum/discuss.php?d=293538">Collaborative Discussion 1</a>. In addition, understanding scientific method allowed me to appreciate the importance of methodology in forensically sound investigations (Anderson & Hepburn, 2020; Holt et al., 2017). The multitasking involved in balancing two modules alongside a full-time job was challenging but also reflects the expectations of working in modern computing roles (Kaur et al., 2020). Overall, successfully balancing these workloads has allowed me to develop my prioritization and time management skills as well as my resilience and confidence. Therefore, I believe this experience has helped me to prepare for the demands of the senior cyber security roles that I intend to take on in future (Gartner, 2022).</p>
									<p>In conclusion, this module has allowed me to build a great foundation for my independent academic research skills and this has already created benefit with regards to my final Masters project, my current role and even the module I have been studying in parallel. Completing this research process has allowed me to explore a new industry and this experience will support me in my goal of becoming a versatile cyber security professional. Overall, I feel both proud that I am equipped to contribute to the cyber security body of knowledge and excited to apply these learnings to my final Masters project starting in May.</p>
