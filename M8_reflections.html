										<h1>Module 8 Reflections</h1>
									</header>
									<p>The various benefits of having studied this module have fallen across four key themes: my work, technical understanding, teamwork skills and stakeholder management skills.</p>
									<h2>Work</h2>
									<p>Working in a cloud security role means there have been many synergies between the content covered in this module and my daily work. For example, having read about CVSS scoring early in the module, I used this understanding to influence a work task to create a repeatable scoring framework for assigning criticality ratings to custom infrastructure guardrails in the cloud (Campbell, 2016). As part of this work, I found the OWASP risk scoring methodology which builds upon CVSS scoring in a way that considers key business impacts (OWASP, N.D.). Not only did this prove to be helpful in my work but I also persuaded my team to utilise it for our <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 11 Team Assignment - Executive Summary.docx">Executive Summary</a>.</p>

									</figure>
									<br></br>
									<p>Developing a foundational knowledge of ethical hacking has also led me to take up opportunities at work to learn more about the field. For example, I attended a session led by the Penetration Testing Team where they covered how to set up and make the most out of Hack the Box (HTB). This included tips on how to use Kali Linux, such as ensuring Kali Linux is updated often as there are constant updates and additions to the toolset. I utilised these tips during my subsequent <a href="https://freya247.github.io/M2_artefacts.html">scanning assignments</a> and will continue to use them going forward, including during a Capture the Flag competition on HTB planned by my colleagues.</p>
									<br></br>
									<h2>Technical</h2>
									<p>Initially I encountered several challenges whilst setting up the Kali Linux Virtual Machine (VM) on my laptop. The issues were mainly down to my laptop having limited SSD memory available. The result was that I was unable to set up the ISO image on VMWare and the VM image I successfully set up soon began to take up too much memory due to frequent updates (Jha, 2021). With limited time and resources available to resolve the problem, I chose to install a 200GB SD card as a drive on my laptop and move the VM files to there with successful results. Whilst this was a highly frustrating process, I learnt a lot from my failures and successes on this learning journey (Alpert, 2018). I also feel better equipped moving forward to choose a suitable laptop for the use cases I plan to pursue, including ethical hacking.</p>

									<br></br>
									<p>Completing three website scanning activities as part of this module allowed me to demonstrate my progression. The <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 3 Practical Activity - Basic Scan.docx">first scan</a> was completed based on my understanding from the module reading and lecturecast. Whilst I persevered to find the required information, I was not satisfied by the lack of efficiency due to my limited experience with the tools. As a result, I began enriching my learning using Immersive Labs which allowed me to practice using the tools and understand what best practice looks like (Immersive Labs, N.D.). I found that the mix of reading and kinesthetic learning was highly effective for absorbing the technical content (University of Kansas, 2019). I was then able to incorporate targeted use of scan options during the <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 7 Scanning Activity.docx">Unit 7 scanning</a> and even use additional tools, for example Nikto, for the scanning to support the <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 11 Team Assignment - Executive Summary.docx">Executive Summary</a>.</p>

									<h2>Teamwork</h2>
									<p>Team Nebula proved to be both a supportive and effective team throughout the module. Roles were assigned in our <a href="M2Links/210511 Meeting 2 Minutes.docx">second team meeting</a> and I took on the role of Project Lead. As we agreed to maintain a flat hierarchy, I developed this role with inspiration from my Scrum Master qualification. Channelling the scrum master role, I endeavoured to remove obstacles for the team, including interfacing with key stakeholders and building structure into team assignments (Scrum.org, N.D.). For example, I proactively made a <a href="M2Links/Meeting Minutes Template.docx">meeting minutes template</a> to ensure we had a uniform way of recording actions and decisions. I then created <a href="https://freya247.github.io/M2_artefacts.html">templates</a> for the summative team assignments as a common structure from the outset ensured contributions were focussed on the assignment requirements. I also led the team in an <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 7 Team Agile Retrospective.pptx">agile retrospective</a> to understand what we could learn from the first half of the module and how we could apply that to the second half. The retrospective was effective in building trust, ensuring all voices were heard, and further improved our teamwork in the remaining weeks.</p>

									<p>I believe we communicated well as a team throughout the module, using various media including Whatsapp and weekly video calls. A particular highlight for me was being introduced to collaborative writing on Google Drive, especially the comments feature, and I will be looking to utilise that tool in future. We also provided support to one another where required. For example, I proactively picked up Craig’s actions when his wife was unwell. I felt this was the right thing to do and, from experience and theory, people can achieve their full potential when their needs are properly supported (McLeod, 2020).</p>

									<br></br>
									<p>The team assignments in this module allowed me to appreciate the importance of both teamwork and diversity of thought in cyber security (Fernandez, 2007). Russell (2006) suggested Robert Kahn’s reasoning for bringing together the Internet Configuration Control Board (ICCB) was that a wider range of ideas from people of different backgrounds is highly beneficial to the end product. In cyber security, I believe the different perspectives create a more exhaustive view on both security challenges and solutions.</p>
									<br></br>
									<h2>Stakeholder Management</h2>
									<p>I acted as the point of contact with our opposing team and negotiated with them regarding their site, including agreeing uptimes to suit my team’s testing plans and creating a win-win situation where both teams could pick the context of the other’s site. I further influenced my team to opt for e-commerce as the majority of our assignments so far on the course have been based on e-health applications. This helped towards my personal objective of widening my knowledge of security across a broad range of industries and provided us with a rich set of security standards to assess against, e.g. PCI DSS.</p>
									<p>I had poor engagement from my peers during the <a href="https://freya247.github.io/M2_artefacts.html">first two discussion forums</a> which limited my opportunity to learn about the topics at hand. For the <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 8 Discussion 3 - Initial Post.docx">third discussion</a>, I decided to post as early as possible. This successfully attracted more response from my peers which allowed me to enrich my summary and this was reflected in my <a href="M2Links/DF3 Summary Tutor Feedback.JPG">tutor feedback</a>. In future, I will ensure I engage early and employ more criticality of my peers’ contributions as this is a key element of studying at master’s level (Millward, 2021).</p>
									<p>Overall, I have learnt a lot in this module that will benefit me in both my work and my future studies.</p>
