										<h1>Module 8 Artefacts</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In the Research Methods and Professional Practice (RMPP) module, various concepts were covered across 12 one week-long units. Each unit is comprised of a combination of reading, discussions, activities, seminars and summative reports. All activities were completed, including all recommended reading, to make the most of my learning journey.</p>
									<h2>Units 1-3</h2>
									<p>The first quarter of the module aimed to build a foundational understanding of scientific research and the corresponding ethical considerations. In these first three weeks, I chose a topic to focus my summative assignments around, participated in an ethical discussion with my peers and reflected upon how ethics applies to the computing profession.</p>

									<br></br>
									<h2>Units 4-6</h2>
									<p>The second quarter of the module looked more specifically at research design. This included considering the privacy of research participants, critiquing questionnaire design and beginning to consider how research design will be applied in my final MSc project.</p>
									<p>Unit 4: <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 4 Discussion 2 - Initial Post.docx">Literature Review Outline</a></p>

									<br></br>
									<h2>Units 7-9</h2>
									<p>The third quarter of the module took a deeper dive into quantitative and qualitative research as well as considering how to accurately draw conclusions from each method. To embed these learnings, I participated in a peer discussion about the ethics of statistics and worked through challenges covering both the analysis and visualisation of data.</p>

									<p>Unit 9: <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 9 Discussion 3 - Peer Responses.docx">Charts Worksheets</a></p>
									<br></br>
									<h2>Units 10-12</h2>
									<p>The final quarter of the module considered the tangible skills that support professional practice, including research writing, professional development and project management. This included completing my research proposal, finalising my ePortfolio and creating an outline for my MSc Project Proposal.</p>
									<p>Unit 10: <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 10 Discussion 3 - Summary Post.docx">Research Proposal</a></p>

									<br></br>
									<h2>Unit 7 (Literature Review) vs. Unit 10 (Research Proposal) Evaluation</h2>
									<p>The strength of the team was made clear when the teamâ€™s <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 6 Team Assignment - Design Document.docx">Design Document</a> attracted a Distinction. This document was a true team effort with strong contributions from the majority of team members. The <a href="M2Links/Design Document Tutor Feedback.JPG">tutor feedback</a> highlighted a number of my contributions to the Design Document as positives, namely the methodology section, timeline Gantt chart and the majority of the business challenges section. As a result, I contributed a significant amount of written content to the <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 11 Team Assignment - Executive Summary.docx">Executive Summary</a>. Based on previous constructive feedback, the team ensured that these contributions included criticality of the methodologies used.</p>
									<p>Learnings from the first summative assignment were drawn out in the sprint retrospective which ensured the team made actionable commitments to improve. The team took a more organised approach to completing the Executive Summary based on our learnings and the fact that it was a longer, more detailed document. For example, through creating a <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 11 CVE Master List.xlsx">CVE Master List</a> to collate CVEs found by team members along with key details to support testing efforts. Thorough planning throughout the module ensured continuity between the plan in the Design Document and execution detailed in the Executive Summary, however the scope of tools was widened in response to particular findings in order to ensure full coverage in the final report.</p>
									<p>In hindsight and based on the intended audience, more of the word count for the Executive Summary should have been dedicated to demonstrating the business and compliance impacts as opposed to the findings themselves. This would have improved the flow of the document and better fulfilled the purpose.</p>
									<p>Overall, the team presented two high quality documents as a result of strong teamwork and commitment to the learning journey, although learnings have emerged that will be taken forward into subsequent assignments.</p>
									<br></br>
									<p>The tasks and assignments in this Module have influenced my learning journey in many different ways.</p>
