										<h1>Module 8 Artefacts</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In the Research Methods and Professional Practice (RMPP) module, various concepts were covered across 12 week-long units. Each unit is comprised of a combination of reading, discussions, activities, seminars and summative assignments. All activities were completed, including all recommended reading, to make the most of my learning journey.</p>
									<h2>Units 1-3</h2>
									<p>The first quarter of the module involved building a foundational understanding of scientific research and the corresponding ethical considerations. In these first three weeks, I chose a topic to focus my summative assignments around, participated in an ethical discussion with my peers, and reflected upon how ethics applies to the computing profession.</p>

									<br></br>
									<h2>Units 4-6</h2>
									<p>The second quarter of the module looked more specifically at research design. This included considering the privacy of research participants, critiquing questionnaire design, and beginning to consider how research design will be applied in my final MSc project.</p>

									<br></br>
									<h2>Units 7-9</h2>
									<p>The third quarter of the module took a deeper dive into quantitative and qualitative research as well as considering how to accurately draw conclusions from each method. To embed these learnings, I participated in a peer discussion about the ethics of statistics and worked through exercises covering both the statistical analysis and visualisation of data.</p>

									<h2>Units 10-12</h2>
									<p>The final quarter of the module covered the tangible skills that support professional practice, including research writing, professional development, and project management. This included completing my research proposal, documenting a professional development plan, and creating an outline for my MSc final project.</p>

									<h2>Unit 7 (Literature Review) vs. Unit 10 (Research Proposal) Evaluation</h2>
									<p>The <a href="M8Links/U7 Literature Review - Final.docx">literature review</a> completed for Unit 7 was the first literature review I have written. It was challenging to learn and apply the various nuances of this form of academic writing in just 7 weeks. In particular, the number of references expected along with the limited word count meant that the wording of the report needed to be more concise than other assignments and this required more planning. In spite of the challenges and using the <a href="M8_feedback.html">tutor feedback</a> from my outline to adjust the direction, I managed to achieve the aims of the assignment and this was reflected in my grade. However, as per the <a href="M8_feedback.html">feedback</a>, the structure was more reminiscent of a report so I will focus on improving this for my final project literature review.</p>
									<p>For my literature review, I researched security controls across all modes of transport to begin with as having an understanding of the whole ecosystem created stronger purpose, criticality and ultimately conclusions in my submission. This approach allowed me to hone in on a key area of current research and created a strong foundation for my Unit 10 <a href="M8Links/U10 Research Proposal.pptx">research proposal</a> which was based on a gap identified in the literature review process, namely cyber recovery controls in Intelligent Transportation Systems. Whilst the <a href="M8_feedback.html">tutor feedback</a> was positive for this assignment, I believe the methodology could be refined further if I were to move forward with this research topic. The subject was so interesting to me that I considered using it as my final project topic, however my <a href="M8Links/U10 MSc Project Outline.docx">chosen topic</a> is more aligned with my current role and therefore more aligned to my <a href="M8Links/U11 Action Plan Template.docx">professional objectives</a>.</p>
									<p>Overall, a diligent approach to both assignments not only allowed me to benefit from the continuation of a single subject throughout the module but it also allowed me to gain experience in moving chronologically through the research process steps ready for my MSc final project.</p>
									<br></br>
									<p>The tasks and assignments in this module have influenced my learning journey in many different ways.</p>
