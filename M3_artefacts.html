										<h1>Module 3 Artefacts</h1>
									</header>
									<p>In the Information Risk Management (IRM) module, various principles, methodologies and challenges were covered across 6 one week units. The key deliverables for the module were a Status Report and an Executive Summary for a risk assessment of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for Acme Manufacturing.</p>
									<h2>Team Assignment Artefacts</h2>
									<p>Unit 3 Status Report: <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 1 Team 3 Contract.docx">Status Report</a></p>
									<p>Unit 6 Executive Summary: <a href="M2Links/M2 Unit 1-3 Discussion 1 - All.docx">Executive Summary</a></p>
									<br></br>
									<h2>Executive Summary Supporting Artefacts</h2>
									<p>Risk Scoring Matrix: <a href="M3Links/Likelihood Impact Matrix(2).xlsx">Custom Risk Matrix</a></p>
									<p>The impact types and measures are based on the business context of Acme Manufacturing. For example, the impact ratings for Financial Loss reflect an SME business. The impacts considered are:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><b>Reputational Damage</b> – This reflects the impact on the reputation of Acme in the eyes of the public and industry peers. Reputational damage could lead to loss of potential or existing customers so can cause an indirect financial loss (Sutton, 2014). Whilst reputational damage is not limited to media coverage and industry criticism, these can be good indicators.</li>
										<li><b>Financial Loss</b> – This reflects the direct financial loss as a result of the risk event being realised. An example of this is loss of revenue.</li>
										<li><b>Customers</b> – This reflects the impacts on Acme’s customer base. This could result in loss of business and reputational damage. With further access to Acme’s data, these measures could be converted to consider the percentage of the customer base impacted and would therefore result in more accuracy regarding the potential impact.</li>
										<li><b>Regulatory/Legal</b> – This reflects the potential regulatory and legal impacts on Acme, from criminal proceedings against senior staff to regulatory fines.</li>
										<li><b>Management Time & Resources</b> – This reflects the impact on management time and resources both in the short and long term. This includes loss of productivity and the impacts on the fulfilment of business objectives.</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Likelihood is then determined based on the evidence that the risk event could materialise within the next 12 months. Whilst this was determined through knowledge of the current threat landscape and publicised incidents, Acme could consider near miss events and non-public intelligence of attacks on peers to increase the accuracy of this metric when risk scoring. </p>
									<p>In the event that the likelihood or impact of an event is determined to be 0, the overall risk score would be 0 to reflect that the event is not in fact a risk.</p>

									<p>The tasks and assignments in this Module have influenced my learning journey in several different ways.</p>
