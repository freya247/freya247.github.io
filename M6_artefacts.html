									<h2>Evaluation of Final Programme (Unit 6) vs. Vulnerability Report (Unit 3)</h2>
									<p>I believe the success of the Unit 3 Report was in part due to the incorporation of tutor feedback from previous modules. For example, we included a clear methodology based on feedback during the Information Risk Management module and ensured to apply criticality to the approach based on feedback in the Network & Information Security Management. It was a challenge to cover all requirements within the limited word count but the feedback suggests we managed to cover the key points well.</p>
									<p>Whilst the Unit 6 Programme has been secured in a number of ways, not all of the vulnerabilities and mitigations from the Unit 3 Report have been addressed due to prioritisation. Controls were prioritised based on the number of vulnerabilities they addressed, the learning opportunity they presented for the team and the timeframe given for the assignment. From experience, prioritisation is a key skill for security professionals as aggressive timelines and limited budgets are commonplace in the real world. In spite of the challenges, we managed to stick to our original design for the most part.</p>
									<p>In addition, when your underlying programming skills are not robust, it can be challenging to focus on both building functionality and applying secure coding practices. The team spent a lot of time focusing on the former for the Unit 6 Programme to ensure that the end product worked and did employ several secure coding techniques, such as input validation, but this is an area for improvement (IEEE, 2014). For example, we could have employed safe failures in the code, including the broker rejecting unrecognised nodes as default. Given the timeframe of the assignment and the limited programming experience in the team, I believe we worked well together and developed a successful end product.</p>
